A predator-prey model demonstrating an evolutionary arms race with respect to flocking behavior.

This effort is undertaken as a final group project for the Simulations of Complex Systems class offered at Chalmers Institute of Technology in Gothenburg, Sweden.

This model employs agent-based simulation to investigate collective flocking behavior under a simple predator-prey incentive: the predator shall catch the prey quickly, and the prey shall not be caught. The control behavior is determined by neural networks acting in each agent, and these neural networks are evolved over time using a genetic algorithm. In this way, an "evolutionary arms race" takes place between predators and prey.
